        <h2 style="text-align: center;">BEST PLACES TO VISIT</h2>

    <p style="font-weight: bolder;">1. Lakes<br></p> 
   <img src="D:\1.can.png"  height="500px" width="1200px"><br> <br>
   <p style="font-style: italic;" > As the second largest country in the world, Canada is blessed with so many beautiful natural sceneries that attract millions of visitors from all over the world. One of the country’s top tourist draws is, of course, its magnificent lakes, which Canada is in abundance of. In fact, the country has the world’s largest amount of freshwater lakes with more than 2 million!

    Some of the most popular Canadian lakes that you should check out include Lake Louise in Alberta, Garibaldi Lake in British Columbia, Lake Superior in Ontario, and Lake Memphremagog in Quebec.</p><br><br>

    <p style="font-weight: bolder;">2. Niagara Fall</p><br>
        <img src="D:\2.can.png" height="500px" width="1200px"><br><br><p style="font-style: italic;">World famous, and for very good reason, the stunning Niagara Falls are a true must-see for anyone visiting the Lake Ontario area during their Canadian stay. These impressive walls of water that is, in reality, three separate waterfalls, the American, the Bridal Veil, and the Horseshoe - straddle the Canadian-US border. And, while they can be viewed from the US side as well, it is from Canada that the best vantage point can be obtained - as it offers an unbroken vista of all three falls. The Canadian side is also home to the Skylon Tower, which lets you tuck into some tasty food from its revolving restaurant while enjoying a majestic elevated view of these ribbons of water. But, for arguably the most impressive view of all, head aboard one of the Maids of the Mist boat tours which ply the turbulent waters at the Falls’ base. There’s no finer way to experience the sheer power of this force of nature than getting up close to the curtains of water.</p><br>
    
        <p style="font-weight: bolder;">3.Beautiful landscapes</p> <br>
            <img src="D:3.can.png" height="500px" width="1200px"><br><br><p style="font-style: italic;"> From the jaw-dropping peaks of the Rockies to the stunning coastlines of Vancouver and Nova Scotia, there are so many beautiful landscapes and nature attractions in Canada. There’s a reason it is home to many UNESCO sites. You could spend a lifetime exploring this vast country and still barely scratch the surface. There are so many wonderful ways in which to experience its picture postcard vistas - from orca watching boat tours on the west coast, to trans-continental rail journeys that will generate memories to last a lifetime. And let’s not forget the landscapes of the Great Lakes and the aforementioned Niagara Falls.
