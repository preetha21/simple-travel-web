    <p style="font-weight: bolder;">1.  Blue Mountains National Park<br></p> 
   <img src="D:\1.au.png" height="500px" width="1200px"><br> <br>
   <p style="font-style: italic;" >Outdoor enthusiasts flock to Australia for a good reason. It offers some of the best nature trips that all ages will enjoy. One such place is Blue Mountains National Park in New South Wales. Located in the Blue Mountains, this protected national park is about 267,954 hectares (662,130 acres). This area is actually a plateau instead of a mountain. There are various rivers throughout the vast region, and its highest point is Mount Werong, at 1,215 meters (3,986 ft) above the sea. This Australian attraction is part of the Greater Blue Mountains Area listed under the UNESCO World Heritage.</p><br><br>

    <p style="font-weight: bolder;">2. Great barrier reef</p><br>
        <img src="D:\2.au.png" height="500px" width="1200px"><br><br><p style="font-style: italic;">It is commonly said that you can spend a whole lifetime exploring the Great Barrier Reef and still not cover everything there is in there. The Great Barrier Reef is the worldâ€™s largest and longest coral reef system that starts at the tip of Cape York right to Bundaberg. Over 1,500 species of fish and other marine life live in the area. It is interesting to observe the interplay of ecosystems and their inhabitants in the reef. The Great Barrier Reef is especially stunning during the annual spawning season. When millions of corals release eggs and sperms into the sea, it is almost like an underwater snowstorm. If snorkeling is on your bucket list, then join a tour that departs from Cairns. On this tour, spend five hours across two different locations on the reef and observe tropical marine life.</p><br>
