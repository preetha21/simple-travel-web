        <h1 style="text-align: center;">Say Hi to SWITZERLAND</h1><br>
        
        
        <p style="text-align: center;font-weight: bolder;font-style: normal;color: rgba(0, 6, 7, 0.605);">Switzerland is geographically divided among the Swiss Plateau, the Alps and the Jura; the Alps occupy the greater part of the territory, whereas most of the country's 8.7 million are concentrated on the plateau, which hosts the largest cities and economic centres, including Zürich, Geneva and Basel.

            Switzerland originates from the Old Swiss Confederacy established in the Late Middle Ages, following a series of military successes against Austria and Burgundy; the Federal Charter of 1291 is considered the country's founding document. Swiss independence from the Holy Roman Empire was formally recognised in the Peace of Westphalia in 1648. Switzerland has maintained a policy of armed neutrality since the 16th century and has not fought an international war since 1815. It joined the United Nations only in 2002, but pursues an active foreign policy that include frequent involvement in peace-building processes worldwide.</p><br>
        <h2 style="text-align: center;">BEST PLACES TO VISIT</h2>
    <p style="font-weight: bolder;">1. Jungfrau region<br></p> 
   <img src="D:\1.swi.png" height="500px" width="1200px"><br> <br>
   <p style="font-style: italic;" > The idyllic Jungfrau region is the icing on the Alpine cake of Switzerland’s Bernese Oberland. Sky-high peaks, glaciers and thundering falls elicit gasps of wonder wherever you go. Grazing the 4000m (13,123ft) mark are Switzerland’s "big three": Eiger (Ogre), Mönch (Monk) and Jungfrau (Virgin), enshrined in mountaineering legend.

    Take a once-in-a-lifetime ride up to the everlasting snow at Europe’s highest train station, 3454m (11,332ft) Jungfraujoch. Hike, ski, sled and zip-line among mountains of myth in Grindelwald, enjoy waterfalls galore in Lauterbrunnen and tackle every kind of extreme sport imaginable in Interlaken (skydiving, ice climbing, glacial bungee jumping – you name it). The Jungfrau region is the great outdoors on a blockbuster scale.</p><br><br>

    <p style="font-weight: bolder;">2. Lake Geneva</p><br>
        <img src="D:\2.swi.png" height="500px" width="1200px"><br><br><p style="font-style: italic;">In Switzerland’s western crook, crescent-shaped Lake Geneva (Lac Léman to Francophones) is a joy to behold, with its mountain backdrop, spirit-lifting views, vineyards and shoreline necklaced with handsome cities and castle-crowned towns.

            Marked by its rainbow-kissed Jet d’Eau fountain and Mont Blanc peeping up on the horizon, Geneva wraps around the lake’s southern shore. The worldly city makes an excellent launchpad for exploring, with big-hitting museums and galleries to absorb, botanical gardens to stroll, lidos to swim at, Old Town cafes to hang out in and bright-yellow mouettes ferrying locals across the water – surely one of the world’s most scenic commutes.</p><br>
    
        <p style="font-weight: bolder;">3.Lake Lucerne</p> <br>
            <img src="D:\3.swi.png" height="500px" width="1200px"><br><br><p style="font-style: italic;">Reclining on the shores of its glittering namesake lake, Lucerne is a walkable, medieval dream of a city that has a magic you can’t quite put your finger on. It will grab you when you are strolling along the promenade as the sun sets in a blaze of gold and pinks or as you cruise across its waters to mountains of myth: 2132m (6995ft) Mt Pilatus, where Wagner raved about the Alpine panorama and Queen Victoria trotted on horseback, and 1797m (5896ft) Rigi, with a light so sublime Turner painted it in three different moods.

                The little city punches far above its weight culturally, with its iconic medieval Kapellbrücke bridge leaping across the Reuss River and the Jean Nouvel–designed KKL arts center and Sammlung Rosengart harboring a prized private collection of Picassos. Ambling past the belle époque hotels lining its shores, the same views that captivated Goethe, Queen Victoria and Wagner in the 19th century will hold you in their thrall. <br></p>
